CHANGES

lib/Catalyst/Helper/Model/ISBNDB.pm:
lib/Catalyst/Model/ISBNDB.pm:
t/DUMMY.pm:
Updated all copyright dates and license information. All license
references are now to the dual-license arrangement (Artistic
2.0 and LGPL). Added use of "warnings" pragma to any modules
that didn't already have it.

Build.PL:
Updated the package version, fixed reference to required perl version
to remove use of v-string, and added some overlooked dependencies in
the "requires" parameter.

t/00_load.t:
Fixed references to modules in this test. For some reason, the
tests referred to the ::XMLRPC Catalyst components, and no one caught it.
